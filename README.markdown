**DISCONTINUED**

I haven't used Vim or Twig in a long time and so haven't made time to keep this up-to-date.

More recent development has taken place at https://github.com/lumiliet/vim-twig


# vim-twig

## About

-----
## Installation

This scripts bundles is compatible with [vim-addon-manager][3]

You can also install (locally) using [Pathogen][4]:

```sh

```
